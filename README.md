# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Features include Data Fetching with Axios library, Clean UI, Search Functionality,
Responsive Design, Debounced Search Output, Page pagination, Aria labels


To run the project:
git clone https://github.com/AdedoyinKups/user-dashboard-jsonplaceholder,
npm install, npm run dev 

Serverside rendering, improved theming for better user interface, option to export data, highlighting the search result are great improvements i'd like to implement if given more time.
